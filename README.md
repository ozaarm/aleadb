#About AleaDB

- Learning with data
If you are interested in computing, databases, data science, getting access to simple data to learn and play with is not easy. There are numerous Open Data datasets online but they are usually static tables.

AleaDB generates a Users table with any number of records you want. A Users table is the central point in a modern application, from an e-commerce website to a ride-hailing service to a social network.
