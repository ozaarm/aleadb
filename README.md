# About AleaDB

Learning SQL and data science is not easy if you are missing data. Although there are numerous Open Data datasets online, there are not connected in a relational kind of way. Starting from a random Users table, AleaDB tries to mimic the database structure from an e-commerce website : Users, Products, Purchases, Orders. More options will follow in the future.
